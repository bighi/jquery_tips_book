### Tip #10: Use a cheat sheet!

This is my last **basic** tip, but it's a very important one. jQuery is a big framework with lots and lots of options. Truste me, you will not memorize it all. 

You will forget something important when you most need it. And it will happen more than once.

Do what every good professional do: cheat!

A cheat sheet is a compendium of the most important stuff, condensed in a few pages (sometimes even one). If you forget something, take a look at the cheat sheet and BAM you remember! You don't have to spend time googling for it.

The guys at Future Colors did an online cheat sheet and you can [see it here](http://http://jqapi.ru/). 

If you want a PDF cheat sheet so you can print, frame and pin it to your wall, [download it here](http://jqapi.ru/_static/jquery.cheatsheet.1.7.pdf).
